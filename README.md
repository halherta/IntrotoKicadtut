These are the Kicad project files used in my Introductory KiCad tutorial. The tutorial is available in two parts:
- [PCB Layout Design with KiCad Part I: Introduction & Schematic Capture](https://hussamtalkstech.com/p/pcb-layout-design-with-kicad-part-i-introduction-schematic-capture/)
- [PCB Layout Design with KiCad Part II: Layout Creation](https://hussamtalkstech.com/p/pcb-layout-design-with-kicad-part-ii-layout-creation/)
